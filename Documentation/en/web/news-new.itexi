@subheading LilyPond 2.21.81 released  @emph{November 29, 2020}

We are happy to announce the release of LilyPond
2.21.81.  This is a further pre-release test version, but these are usually
reliable.  We encourage all users and developers to download this
version to test it to allow us to release a new stable version.
If you want to use the current stable version of LilyPond,
we recommend using the 2.20.0 version.
